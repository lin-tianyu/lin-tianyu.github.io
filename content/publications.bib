abstract={Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction, such as Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, prioritize pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels. Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures. CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical, implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving up to 32% improvement for large organs, 22% for small organs, 40% for intestines, and 36% for vessels.},

  abstract={Diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness across various generative tasks. However, when applied to medical image segmentation, these models encounter several challenges, including significant resource and time requirements. They also necessitate a multi-step reverse process and multiple samples to produce reliable predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the first latent diffusion segmentation model, named SDSeg, built upon stable diffusion (SD). SDSeg incorporates a straightforward latent estimation strategy to facilitate a single-step reverse process and utilizes latent fusion concatenation to remove the necessity for multiple samples. Extensive experiments indicate that SDSeg surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets featuring diverse imaging modalities. Remarkably, SDSeg is capable of generating stable predictions with a solitary reverse step and sample, epitomizing the model’s stability as implied by its name. The code is available at https://github.com/lin-tianyu/Stable-Diffusion-Seg.},

  abstract={Large, high-quality, annotated datasets are the foundation of medical AI research, but constructing even a small, moderate-quality, annotated dataset can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. Although active learning can prioritize what to annotate, scaling up still requires extensive manual efforts to revise the noisy annotations. We formulate this as a missing-data problem and develop ScaleMAI, a framework that unifies data annotation and model development co-evolution through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process. In this iterative process, the AI model automatically identifies and corrects the mistakes in annotations (Expectation), while the refined annotated data retrain the model to improve accuracy (Maximization). In addition to the classical EM algorithm, ScaleMAI brings human experts into the loop to review annotations that cannot be adequately addressed by either Expectation or Maximization step (<5%). As a result, ScaleMAI progressively creates an annotated dataset of 47,315 CT scans (4.8x larger than the largest public dataset, PanTS) including 4,163,720 per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 88 anatomical structures. ScaleMAI iteratively trains a model that exceeds human expert performance in tumor diagnosis (+7%), and outperforms models developed from smaller, moderate-quality datasets, with statistically significant gains in tumor detection (+10%) and segmentation (+14%) on two prestigious benchmarks.},

abstract={The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong and versatile segmentation capabilities, along with intuitive prompt-based interactions. However, customizing SAM for medical image segmentation requires massive amounts of pixel-level annotations and precise point- or box-based prompt designs. To address these challenges, we introduce PGP-SAM, a novel prototype-based few-shot tuning approach that uses limited samples to replace tedious manual prompts. Our key idea is to leverage inter- and intra-class prototypes to capture class-specific knowledge and relationships. We propose two main components: (1) a plug-and-play contextual modulation module that integrates multi-scale information, and (2) a class-guided cross-attention mechanism that fuses prototypes and features for automatic prompt generation. Experiments on a public multi-organ dataset and a private ventricle dataset demonstrate that PGP-SAM achieves superior mean Dice scores compared with existing prompt-free SAM variants, while using only 10% of the 2D slices.},

abstract={Arterial thickness is a crucial metric for evaluating the risk of atherosclerosis, often measured from ultrasound images. We propose a new learning framework, priority-guided contrastive network, for accurate delineation of artery. Our network can effectively balance data distribution and ensure that critical boundary details are captured with reduced errors. Specifically, the network prioritizes underrepresented pixels of arterial regions by dynamic priority induction and extract anchor pixels from ambiguous pseudo-labels via contrastive learning. These pixels are converted into meaningful supervision signals, so our network can focus on critical yet scarce regions and capture anatomical continuity in the artery. Experimental evaluations on two datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.815 and 0.726 under extreme low-label partition protocols. Our approach outperforms multiple detection methods of common computer vision and artery. Our method shows potential for application beyond the particular training data used in the study. The accuracy afforded by the framework would allow it to be incorporated into the clinical workflow for improved detection of artery.},

abstract={Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models have recently demonstrated remarkable in various image generation tasks. With robust nonlinear modeling capacity and superior generalization performance, denoising diffusion models are being progressively applied in medical image segmentation. However, popular diffusion models trained with 3D patch-based or 2D slice-wise inputs may lack a global anatomical perception of medical tissues and performing operations in pixel space incurs substantial computational overhead. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework, called Enhancing Medical image Segmentation based on Stable Diffusion (EMSSD), to elevate segmentation accuracy. A 3D segmentation model is pretrained in the first stage to obtain coarse segmentation maps which along with the input images are jointly encoded as constraints into latent diffusion model to direct model's attention to the target region in the second stage. To sharpen the guidance of fuzzy boundary prior from coarse segmentation results while adequately leveraging the medical images, we design a Condition Fusion Module (CFM) to aggregate both conditions. We also introduce a single-step reverse process to replace multi-step to optimize time efficiency. Experiments conducted on two datasets have substantiated the effective-ness and generalization of our approach.},

Large language models (LLMs) offer potential support in crisis assessments, yet their effectiveness in emotionally sensitive, real-world clinical settings remains underexplored. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a comprehensive benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four key tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. 64 LLMs across 15 model families (including closed-source such as GPT, Claude, Gemini and open-source such as Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) were evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. LLMs showed strong results in suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), with notable gains from few-shot prompting and fine-tuning. Compared to trained human operators, LLMs achieved comparable or superior performance on suicide plan identification and risk assessment, while humans retained advantages on mood status recognition and suicidal ideation detection. Mood status recognition remained challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to missing vocal cues and semantic ambiguity. Notably, a fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) outperformed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation tasks. LLMs demonstrate performance broadly comparable to trained human operators in text-based crisis assessment, with complementary strengths across task types. PsyCrisisBench provides a robust, real-world evaluation framework to guide future model development and ethical deployment in clinical mental health.},

Each scan includes metadata such as patient age, sex, diagnosis, contrast phase, in-plane spacing, slice thickness, etc. AI models trained on PanTS achieve significantly better performance in pancreatic tumor detection, localization, and segmentation than those trained on existing public datasets. Our analysis indicates that these gains are directly attributable to the 16× larger-scale tumor annotations and indirectly supported by the 24 additional surrounding anatomical structures.

abstract={Eye movements, including saccades, are widely regarded as highly sensitive and objective biomarkers of neurophysiologic states. Detecting saccadic signatures in neurologic diseases offers a promising, rapid, portable, and non-invasive alternative to current diagnostic tools, such as brain imaging, while overcoming access limitations and cost barriers. Currently, no robust video-oculographic solutions exist for localizing brain abnormalities due to privacy concerns and the lack of large datasets required to train accurate, reliable models. In this work, we propose the first fully synthetic, patient data-free, multimodal eye movement generation pipeline for building a generalizable dataset for saccade analysis. Using this synthetic dataset, we trained a deep learning classifier to distinguish between normal and abnormal (hypometria and hypermetria) saccadic accuracies, and evaluated its performance on real-world clinical data. The model achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and sensitivity of 0.71, showing that the synthetic data has strong potential to generalize for clinical applications. This work highlights the potential of synthetic eye movement data to be used to develop screening tools for at-home and emergency room settings.},

abstract={Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis, yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital), and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor segmentation in internal and external validation—F1 Score increased by up to 16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g., 50), and when many masks are available (e.g., 1.7K).},

abstract={Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing methods typically transfer the original training process directly without specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction. Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.},

We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent.},

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.},

abstract={Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.},
